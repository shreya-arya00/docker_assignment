Here's a README file that explains how to implement the Docker Compose manifest, configure sensitive and configurable variables, manage Docker volumes, and run the containers:

# Dockerized PostgreSQL Database
This repository contains files to set up a Docker Compose manifest for creating a PostgreSQL database container. It includes instructions for overriding default credentials, passing sensitive and configurable variables using an .env file, configuring Docker volumes for data persistence, and running the containers.

# Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the PostgreSQL database container locally.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. You can download and install Docker Desktop from here.

# Configuration

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository_url>

2.Navigate to the repository directory:
cd <repository_directory>

3. Create a .env file in the repository directory and specify the sensitive and configurable variables:

POSTGRES_USER=myuser
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword
POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase
Replace myuser, mypassword, and mydatabase with your desired username, password, and database name, respectively.

# Running the Containers
Run the following command to start the PostgreSQL database container:

docker-compose up -d
This command will build the Docker image and start the container in detached mode.

# Verification
To verify that the container is running and accessible, you can use a database management tool such as DBeaver to connect to the PostgreSQL database using the following credentials:

Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Username: <POSTGRES_USER>
Password: <POSTGRES_PASSWORD>
Database: <POSTGRES_DB>
Make sure to replace <POSTGRES_USER>, <POSTGRES_PASSWORD>, and <POSTGRES_DB> with the values specified in your .env file.

# Stopping the Containers
To stop the PostgreSQL database container, run:

docker-compose down
This command will stop and remove the containers.

# Data Persistence
Data in the PostgreSQL database will be persisted across container restarts and re-creations thanks to Docker volumes. The data is stored in a Docker volume named postgres-data, which is created and managed by Docker Compose.

Feel free to modify and enhance this README file as needed to fit your specific project requirements.
